I am a biomedical engineer and scientist who develops physical sensors. I graduated with my PhD from the [Meng Lab](https://biomems.usc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at USC in 2021, where I built [MEMS sensors and a measurement platform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8808653){:target="\_blank"} to diagnose shunted patients. My research also included an [analytical physical model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9390289){:target="\_blank"} of thermal impedimetric flow sensors which can be used for design iteration *in silica*. I also worked on a contactless flow sensor for a congenital heart disorder in collaboration with [Dr. Vishal Nigam](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/developmental-biology-regenerative-medicine/labs/nigam-lab/){:target="\_blank"}.

I graduated with a BS in Bioengineering from Rice University in 2014. Prior to grad school, I researched at the Naval Research Lab in Washington D.C., the Grande-Allen and McDevitt labs at Rice, and the Swanson lab at the UW in Seattle.
